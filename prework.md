# Las Vegas Front-end Engineering Pre-work
Three months is a short amount of time to teach you everything you need to know to be a great front-end developer. To make sure that we can move as fast as possible and cover all of the topics that we need to cover, here's a list of exercises and reading materials to get you up to speed. Please complete this work before the first day of class.

I expect you to be able to complete these exercises on your own, but if you run into trouble you're welcome to email me: <mike.sweeney@theironyard.com.>

### Git
As described below git is a version control system we will use extensively in this class. Once you have completed the install process for homebrew (located in the "setup" lesson) simply type: brew install git

If it mentions git already being installed try: brew upgrade git

### HTML/CSS:
HTML and CSS are the foundation of all the content of a webpage or web app. However, we will only be spending about two weeks on HTML and CSS, so having a basic foundation before class will be very helpful.

Complete the Codecademy course at http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web. This should take you approximately 7 hours, depending on your prior experience.

### JavaScript:
We will spend most of our time talking about JavaScript. JavaScript allows us to add interaction to our web applications.

Complete the Codecademy course at http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web. This should take you approximately 7 hours, depending on your prior experience.

This is not how our course will be taught ­­ but it’s great to get yourself as familiar as possible with some of the syntax of the language.

### Command Line
Mastery of command line basics is essential for any developer (and extremely useful for non­devs) and will make your life much easier. Go through the following tutorial, paying special attention to the instructions to create notecards for memorization. You won't have to memorize many things in this course, but memorizing command line commands is essential: http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/

### Software
Before starting at The Iron Yard you will need a few pieces of free software. Please download and install the following software.

1. Download and install [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). This is the tool we will use to write code.
2. Install OSX El Capitan (or newer), if you haven’t already.
    1. You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
    2. Download the El Capitan upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://www.apple.com/osx/).
    3. Click "Upgrade Now” to begin installation.

  **WARNING:** The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.
3. Have the latest version of [Google Chrome installed](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)

Add google chrome and sublime to your dock.

### Accounts
We will use a couple of online services throughout during the class. Please create accounts on these services so that you're ready to rock on day 1.

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com). Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name.

1. You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).

### Git
Working with Git will be a huge part of this class. Familiarity with it is going to be a requirement almost anywhere you end up working. Its purpose is to store "snapshots" (called commits) of your code, so you can see your progress and revert your changes if necessary. It also makes it easy to push your changes to a server, which acts as a backup of your code and a way to collaborate with other programmers.

Sign up for a (http://github.com)[Github] account, as it is the most popular Git host and the one we'll be using throughout the class. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name. Then, work through (https://try.github.io)[Try Github], a short course on how to use Git.

### Basic OS X Skills (optional)
If this is your first time using a Mac it might slow you down at first. It's important to get as comfortable as possible with your laptop before class. If this is your first time using a mac, or you need to brush up on some of your basic computer skills read through these tutorials:

* [Mac Basics](https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/)
* [Window Basics](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18785?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)
* [Finder Basics](http://support.apple.com/kb/VI209?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)
